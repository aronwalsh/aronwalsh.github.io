I am an academic researcher with an interest in connecting microscopic chemical interactions to the macroscopic physical properties of materials. There are more details over on my [group website](https://wmd-group.github.io).

I work as [Professor in Materials Design](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.walsh) at Imperial College London with prior experience at [Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie), [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov), [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk), [University of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk) and [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr). 

As an Associate Editor at [Journal of the American Chemical Society](https://pubs.acs.org/journal/jacsat), I covers content related to materials for energy and artificial intelligence.
