While LaTeX may not have evolved too much over the decades, interfaces and packages have modernised. My standard writing workflow is now to use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) for collaborative LaTeX documents. It avoids having a working installation locally and you can auto-synch to Dropbox or Github for working offline if you prefer. 

I also like [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) for managing my research paper library. I pay $20 a year for 2 GB cloud storage, which gives me access to the pdfs and notes everywhere. One approach is to use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) to export a ``.bib`` file and upload that to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com), but it's a little too manual. If you click `upload` on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com), you can create a synched connection to a specific [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) library.

This approach is convenient, but where are the citation keys? Rather than looking them up in the bib file, another approach is the [Better BibTeX for Zotero](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/installation/) extension. It installs in a few clicks. You can customise the format of the citation key. One subtlety in Zotero (due to the way the API access works) is that you need to select-all files in your library, right click, then choose `Better Bibtex` and `Pin BibTex key`. Phew, all done! Back to writing...
