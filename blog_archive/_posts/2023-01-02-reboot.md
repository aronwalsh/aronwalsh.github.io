One of my first online experiences was internet relay chat with the excitement of connecting from my bedroom in Ireland to random people around the world (`a/s/l` anyone?). There has been the rise and fall of countless internet platforms since then. 

I first started this blog as a fresh PhD graduate in 2007 with iWeb (a defunct service from Apple). I then moved to Wordpress, which was decent at the time, but gradually removed features from free accounts, loaded more advertisements, and transitioned to a content editor that became less usable as the years rolled by. So eventually, I gave up.

Fortunately, [https://import.jekyllrb.com](https://import.jekyllrb.com) saved the day. After exporting an xml archive, `jekyll import wordpressdotcom` quickly turned all of the old posts into markdown and allowed me to port over here powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [Github](https://pages.github.com). Some posts could benefit from a syntax refresh, but time is finite.

We all start the new year with the best intentions. Let's see if I can keep this going...
