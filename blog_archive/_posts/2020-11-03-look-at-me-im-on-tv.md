<p>I used to edit videos as a hobby. It was back in the day of MiniDV tapes and a trusty firewire connection. It drove my old computers to their limits the video processing would take hours (often overnight).</p>

<p>In 2020, I have been pushed back into making more and more videos. From the perspective of recording lectures or conference talks, here are some tips that have helped me to survive on my MacBook, working from home.</p>

<p>My philosophy is very much getting to something reasonable with minimal effort.</p>

## Software
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Basics</strong> - The command line package <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org">FFmpeg</a> is invaluable for many tasks such as video trimming and format changes. I have used <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/imovie/">iMovie</a> a couple of times when I have had a long recording with a small interruption (e.g. fireworks outside or sneezing) that I want to edit out. It is limited, but does the job for free. The default Quicktime player can also trim videos (Edit: Trim) with little fuss.</p>

<p><strong>Zoom</strong> - If you need something fast and simple, start a Zoom conversation with yourself, share your screen, and hit record. The resulting mp4 file will be a reasonable size and feature your talking head on the upper right. Job done! Of course if you need to see your notes, you are are better off with a second screen (which gets shared) and you can then look at presenter mode on the main screen in front of the camera. </p>

<p><strong>OBS</strong> - You may want something more bespoke. Perhaps, the combination of slides, a talking head, and a digital whiteboard. Then <a href="https://obsproject.com">OBS</a> has you covered. It takes about an hour to master, and there are plenty of tutorials online (e.g. <a href="https://bioceed.uib.no/dropfolder/bioCEED/How%20to%20film%20your%20lectures%20using%20OBS%20studio.pdf">here</a>). Note that you probably want to <em>record</em> (make a video file) rather than <em>stream</em>, and you can change the output settings in the video settings panel. 1920 x 1080 at 30 fps is a safe choice for most purposes. </p>

## Hardware

<p>I have a small desk at home, so try to keep a minimalist setup, but it has been expanding each month...</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>MacBook Pro</strong> - I am disappointed by how easily this heats up and the fans start whirling. I guess it's the price of such a compact design. I had to buy a Â£15 <a href="https://uk.thermaltake.com/thermaltake-massive-s14-nb-cooler.html">cooling stand</a> to keep my fingers from being slowly cooked. It turns out the stand is actually useful for hiding cables beneath, so I won't complain too much. </p>

<p><strong>Logitech Brio</strong> - the MacBook Pro camera should be better that it is. To have more flexibility and to deal better with low light, I splashed out on this Logitech <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/product/brio">webcam</a>. It's fine, but I wouldn't recommend it greatly as the 4K mode is limited by a small sensor. Any HD webcam should be sufficient.</p>

<p><strong>Shure MK5</strong> - as the laptop microphone is built into the keyboard, it doesn't cope well with fan noise. I went for the most compact <a href="https://www.shure.com/en-GB/products/microphones/mv5">cardioid mic</a> I could find with good reviews. I have no complaints and it looks stylish. It gives a full sound and avoid background noise (including my humming fridge, occasional fox howls, and the odd police siren).</p>
<p><strong>iPad Pro</strong> - This has been invaluable for remote work in terms of reading and writing manuscripts, exams, etc. It also doubles up as my second monitor via Sidecar (note, the USB-C connection avoids the wifi drain of wireless connection), which is useful for presentations. A neat point is that you can also use the stylus feature when it is a second screen, so you can annotate while presenting. </p>
