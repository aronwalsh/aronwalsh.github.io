<p>Life was comfortable back in 2007. While starting to work on quaternary semiconductors for thin-film solar cells, there was very little literature. It was possible to read <em>all</em> of the papers in the field. Since the report of a 10% efficient solar cell made from Cu<sub>2</sub>ZnSn(S,Se)<sub>4</sub> in 2010, interest in the field exploded and there now stands over 1000 publications. I feel sorry for any new graduate student beginning a project...</p>

<p><em>Web of Science search for "Kesterite OR CZTS solar cell" with 1155 results - May 2015</em></p>

<p>From reading quite a few of these papers and attending conferences and workshops over the years, here is a decent reading list to get started:</p>
<p>1. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040609008013953"><strong>Development of CZTS-based thin film solar cells </strong></a>(Thin Solid Films, 2009) - An important historical overview of the development of the field. Like many technologies, it all started in Japan.</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pssb.200879539/abstract"><strong>New routes to sustainable photovoltaics: evaluation of Cu2ZnSnS4 as an alternative absorber material</strong></a> (Physica Status Solidi B, 2008) - An important paper from Jonathan Scragg (whose PhD thesis turned into the first <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Copper-Zinc-Sulfide-Films-Photovoltaics/dp/3642229182/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1432801709&amp;sr=1-1">book</a> on kesterite solar cells) with layers made by electrodeposition.</p>
<p>3. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927024811000031"><strong>The crystal structure of kesterite type compounds: A neutron and X-ray diffraction study </strong></a>(Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, 2011) - X-ray diffraction has trouble distinguishing between Cu and Zn. Neutron diffraction confirms the ground-state crystal structure (not stannite) and the tendency for cation disorder.</p>
<p>4. <strong><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aenm.201100630/abstract">Kesterite Thin-Film Solar Cells: Advances in Materials Modelling of Cu2ZnSnS4</a> </strong>(Advanced Energy Materials, 2012) - The complexity of these materials has provided a fertile ground for theory and simulation, with early efforts reviewed here on structure, defects and band energies.</p>
<p>5. <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jz501864a"><strong>8.6% Efficient CZTSSe Solar Cells Sprayed from Water–Ethanol CZTS Colloidal Solutions</strong></a> (Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters, 2014) - simple, clean and easy to scale up, with more recent reports of reproducible 10% efficiency from this approach.</p>
<p>6. <strong><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aenm.201301465/full">Device Characteristics of CZTSSe Thin-Film Solar Cells with 12.6% Efficiency </a></strong>(Advanced Energy Materials, 2014) - The current record device with 12.6% efficiency. The one to beat!</p>

The team at IREC are leading the way.</p>
<p>8. <a href="http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jap/116/8/10.1063/1.4893315"><strong>Suns-<i>V<sub>OC</sub> </i> characteristics of high performance kesterite solar cells</strong></a> (Journal of Applied Physics, 2014) - What is limiting performance to less than 20%?
