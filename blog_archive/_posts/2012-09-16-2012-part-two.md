<p>The second third of the year has involved studies of new photo-active materials (including one previously unknown) and a quaternary high-temperature antiferromagnet.</p>

<li><a href="http://apl.aip.org/resource/1/applab/v100/i25/p251911">"Bandgap engineering of ZnSnP2 for high-efficiency solar cells"</a> D. O. Scanlon and A. Walsh, Applied Physics Letters 100, 251911 (2012).</li>
</ul>
<p>As the demand for solar cells increases, diversity in the materials (and source elements) involved is essential. ZnSnP2 is one very interesting case, where a single material system has the potential for high-efficiency light-to-electricity conversion. This work resulted from a collaboration with <a href="http://www.davidscanlon.com/">Dr. David Scanlon</a>, currently a Ramsay Fellow at University College London.</p>

<li><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jssc.2012.06.013">"A photoactive titanate with a stereochemically active Sn lone pair: Electronic and crystal structure of Sn2TiO4 from computational chemistry"</a> L. A. Burton and A. Walsh, Journal of Solid-State Chemistry 196, 157 (2012).</li>
</ul>
<p>My PhD research on lone pairs in the solid-state was reborn during my postdoctoral work, when I came across BiVO4 as a promising photocatalyst for H2 production from water. The Bi(III) ion has a stereochemically active 6s2 lone pair, which results in a reduced ionisation potential for the material. Sn2TiO4 is a novel analog, which combines Sn(II) and Ti(IV), and was one of the first projects for my PhD student Lee Burton.</p>

</ul>
<p>For his final year undergraduate project at Oxford, Russell Woolley was charged with synthesising a quinternary alloy and measuring its magnetic response. On top of that, he had the energy to perform to electronic structure calculations, before eventually moving to <a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/fuelcells">Imperial College</a> for his PhD. This paper  covers one of the end member compounds, which itself is sufficient complex to warrant the input from nine authors, and just as many solid-state techniques.</p>

<p>A subsection of the <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/klmc/">Kathleen Lonsdale Materials Chemistry</a> group at University College London is the Phantom Fellows. Our investigation of CuF resulted from a side-project of a sub-project of a splinter-project originally conceived by <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/klmc/People/Sokol.html">Dr. Alexey A. Sokol</a>. It is the type of work that keeps things interesting when your main research is not going to plan.
