<p>Moving continent is a great source for procrastination: filling boxes, emptying boxes, rearrangements and reorganizations galore. Another pair of transatlantic flights (this time to the IEEE <a title="http://www.34pvsc.org" href="http://www.34pvsc.org/">Photovoltaics Specialist Conference </a>in Philadelphia) will provide the internet-free time I need.</p>
<p><a title="http://www39.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=who+am+i?" href="http://www39.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=who+am+i%3F">Wolfram Alpha</a> is a strange one. Nice for graphing whatever function comes into your mind, but it gets confused a little too often for its own good. The <a title="http://www86.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=In2O3+VS+SnO2" href="http://www86.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=In2O3+VS+SnO2">comparing compounds</a> feature is fun, and I imagine it would be quite useful for a synthetic chemist. I could see it morphing into a chemistry version of Top Trumps; a potential tool for hooking ten year olds into the magic of the periodic table.</p>
<p>In other developments, last week the head of Shell’s renewable energy wing <a title="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hZATH3qLZ_tkjnejbzGrzmKz7P5QD98DUN681" href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hZATH3qLZ_tkjnejbzGrzmKz7P5QD98DUN681">stepped down</a>. This is probably not too surprising considering that Shell recently announced their abandonment of research and development of solar and wind power. Not satisfied with <a title="http://www.corribsos.com" href="http://www.corribsos.com/">pillaging the Irish coast line</a> while charging plenty for it, a company that pulled in $26 billion of profit last year cannot afford to spend a little on harnessing our most abundant energy sources. I really hope I live to see the complete collapse of oil companies.</p>
<p>Finally, the last episode in Season Two of <a title="http://www.amctv.com/originals/breakingbad/about/" href="http://www.amctv.com/originals/breakingbad/about/">Breaking Bad</a> is on tonight. An incredibly intense twelve episodes so far. It does of course have some lighter moments, such as how to make a DIY Faradic battery using acid and loose change to kick-start a dead van in a desert, but overall, this is definitely the best show on TV right right now.</p>
