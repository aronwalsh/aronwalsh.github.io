Having time to read was one of the few perks of feeling ill over the Christmas holidays. I had a chance to finish the 1964 classic text by J. M. Ziman, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Principles-Theory-Solids-J-Ziman/dp/0521297338/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420549902&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=9780521297332">Principles of the Theory of Solids</a>. He writes with a certain eloquence and authority that you don’t often find in physical science. It is not a text for true beginners, but addresses many fundamental concepts in condensed-matter physics with a unique perspective and a clear narrative.

<strong>A few choice quotes to stimulate the mind:</strong>

Lattice periodicity and k-points:
<i>“There are exactly as many allowed wave-vectors in a Brillouin zone as there are unit cells in a block of crystal."</i>

Electrostatic summations of ionic solids:
<i>“The problem of computing such a sum becomes very serious. The best direct method is that of Evjen, where one treats successive shells, going outward from the origin, each one being exactly neutral in charge."</i>

Special points in an electronic band structure:
<i>“For a given amount of computing, we can get more accurate values of E(k) at points of high symmetry, than we can at an arbitrary point in the [Brillouin] zone.”</i>

Ionic semiconductors:
<i>“It is doubtful whether a hole can move like a free particle in an ionic crystal. The small overlap between valence orbitals on neighbouring ions implies a very narrow valence band with a correspondingly high effective mass."</i>

Carrier mobility in semiconductors:
<i>“The scattering of carriers by lattice vibrations in semiconductors is, in general, a much simpler problem. Because the carriers are usually thought of as concentrated in a small region of k-space, near a minimum in E(k), the possible change of k-vector in the scattering is small.”</i>

Ising model:
<i>“The importance of the Ising model is not, however, in the description of particular physics effects; it is a mathematically tractable model of a system that should exhibit co-operative phenomena and phase transitions."</i>
