<p><a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/klmc/People/Catlow.html">Prof. C. Richard A. Catlow FRS</a> recently turned 65, and I attended a very stimulating symposium held in his honour yesterday at University College London.</p>

<p>The initial session combined talks from Richard's third PhD student (<a href="http://people.bath.ac.uk/chsscp/">Prof. Steve Parker</a>), experimental "sidekick" (<a href="http://www.kent.ac.uk/physical-sciences/staff/profiles/alan-chadwick.html">Prof. Alan Chadwick</a>), and a selection of his current research stars (<a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/klmc/People/Woodley.html">Scott Woodley</a>, <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/klmc/People/Sokol.html">Alexey Sokol</a>, <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/klmc/People/Scanlon.html">David Scanlon</a> and <a href="http://www.rc-harwell.ac.uk/">Nikolaos Dimitratos</a>). Richard ended the afternoon with a public science lecture covering five career-spanning topics (with a stream of publications in Proc. Roy. Soc. and Nature; the former used to me more prestigious than the latter!).</p>
<p><strong>1. Forces between atoms</strong><br />
- The development and validation of interatomic potentials, beginning with a fluoride potential in 1972.<br />
<strong>2. Fascination of disorder</strong><br />
- Non-stoichiometric oxides and the utility of EXAFS.<br />
<strong>3. Facilitates and facilitation</strong><br />
- The development of synchrotron diffraction at Daresbury Laboratories.<br />
<strong>4. Transforming molecules</strong><br />
-Â  Heterogeneous catalysis: modelling of barriers and pathways.<br />
<strong>5. Impact and interdisciplinary</strong><br />
- How models of fission products; zeolite templating and planetary formation had wide-ranging impact.</p>
<p>The message of the day was "If the model has the right physics, you can't go too wrong".</p>
