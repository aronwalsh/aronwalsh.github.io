<p>Occasionally I find time for life outside of the periodic table, which usually involves a combination of food, music and cinema. In the latter category, melancholic Japanese dramas hold a special place in my heart. Some of my favourites:</p>
<ul>
<li>式日 (Shiki-Jitsu, 2000). Directed by Hideaki Anno (Evangelion) and based on the novel of the lead actress, this movie is very special. Imagine Stanley Kubrick filming a love story after (or during) a nervous breakdown. A disturbing fight between fantasy and reality.</li>
<li>世界の中心で、愛をさけぶ (Crying Out Love, in the Center of the World). This 2004 movie can be summed up as two girls, a boy and leukemia. In the first half you are given many pieces to a puzzle, which fall beautifully into place in the second half.</li>
<li>リリイ・シュシュのすべて (All about Lily Chou-Chou). Released in 2001, Shunji Iwai set a standard for 21st century film that few can match. A coming-of-age story set against the backdrop (and inspired by) an internet chatroom for a fictional signer, Lily Chou Chou. I dare you not to cry.</li>
<li>虹の女神 (Rainbow Song, 2006). At least the heroine is dead form the start here. A talented director dies in a plane crash in America, while her friends and family in Japan try to cope with the loss. It all culminates with her debut college film, 'The End of the World'.</li>
<li>空気人形 (Air Doll). I was lucky enough to see this at a festival in 2009. The wonderful Korean actress Bae Doona (The Host) is a sex doll that comes alive. A story of loneliness, humanity and existentialism, with flawless cinematography and a delicate soundtrack by World's End Girlfriend.</li>
</ul>
