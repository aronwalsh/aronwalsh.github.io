<p>I am not sure what over research fields are like, but it is quite common in computational chemistry / materials science to keep small analysis codes, scripts and tricks hidden within a research group. With an increasing number of open access projects and packages, this situation is changing.</p>
<p>I regularly get mails from students requesting pieces of information relating to papers I have published. My new policy is to put everything useful and requested online. The best route is not clear, but for the moment, I am adding it to my research group's <a href="https://github.com/WMD-group">GitHub</a>. The latest additions include the crystal structure of MIL-125, an inverse spinel geometry, indium oxide nanoclusters and kesterite polytypes (see <a href="https://github.com/WMD-Bath/Crystal_Structures">here</a>).</p>
<p>In terms of version control for codes, both <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> do a fine job, especially when paired with <a href="http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">Sourcetree</a>. On paper, Bitbucket should be the winner as they offer both public and private repositories for free, but they can't compete with the Github mascot (octocat):</p>

Now it's time to learn more python with <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/#!/exercises/0">Code Academy</a>.
