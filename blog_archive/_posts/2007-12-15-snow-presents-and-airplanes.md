I’m just about packed to spend Christmas back in Ireland and new year’s in Paris. I should be picking up a little statue at the <a title="http://www.ria.ie/committees/chemicalandphysicalsciences/chemists.html" href="http://www.ria.ie/committees/chemicalandphysicalsciences/chemists.html">Royal Irish Academy</a> along the way (I’m not sure where the ‘royal’ comes from, but I can forgive them for past associations).

<p>Backing up data on windows has always been a bit of a pain. I came across a nice open source program which does everything you could ever want (incremental backups, encryption, compression, scheduling).  Get <a title="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cobianbackup" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cobianbackup">Cobian</a> here. For the mac <a title="http://homepage.mac.com/sweetcocoa/imsafe" href="http://homepage.mac.com/sweetcocoa/imsafe">iMsafe</a> is great (although it is no longer freeware). Also for visualization junkies, VICS-II had been majority upgraded to <a title="http://www.geocities.jp/kmo_mma/crystal/en/vesta.html" href="http://www.geocities.jp/kmo_mma/crystal/en/vesta.html">VESTA</a> (which now supports VASP charge density files directly), and <a title="http://schmeling.ac.rwth-aachen.de/user/bernhard/wxdragon.html" href="http://schmeling.ac.rwth-aachen.de/user/bernhard/wxdragon.html">wxDragon</a> has been bumped up to a new version.</p>
