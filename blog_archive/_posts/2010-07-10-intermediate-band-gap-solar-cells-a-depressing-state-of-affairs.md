<p>As the field of dilute magnetic semiconductors continues to thrive in the slums of <em>caveat emptor</em> calculations, it appears that intermediate band gap solar cells are following a similar fate.</p>
<p>Building upon much earlier work in the field, in 1997 <a title="http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.78.5014" href="http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.78.5014">Luque and Marti</a> calculated that introducing an intermediate band gap state (IB) into a semiconductor could offer a means to achieve solar conversion efficiencies of up to 63.1%, well beyond the single-junction limit. This could be achieved in many ways, but one of the most straightforward is through impurity doping.</p>
<p>The principal assumption of the high efficiency is that there exists a half-filled, localised defect band 0.7 eV above the valence band (as it is half-filled, valence -&gt; IB and IB -&gt; conduction band optical transitions are independent). Generally, a localised half-filled band will be subject to a Peierls distortion, so it is not an easy task. A perfect case for electronic structure theory to lead the way...</p>
<p>One of the early disasters was doping of the <a title="http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.65.165115" href="http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.65.165115">III-V materials GaAs and GaP</a>, e.g. an excellent IB was predicted when Ti is substituted on the *anion* site (over a series of papers!). Much of the subsequent work focused on <a title="http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v101/i4/e046403" href="http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v101/i4/e046403">transition metal doping and alloying</a> of oxides, II-VI and III-V compounds; however, it is well demonstrated that standard local/semi-local density functionals cannot deal with transition metals, especially when you are interested in quantitative band positions and optical absorption properties. In particular, it is difficult to see how a partially occupied 3d band could be stable with respect to a Jahn-Teller distortion. The same issue applies to recent work on Ti and Cr doping of the Ga site in <a title="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solmat.2010.06.019" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solmat.2010.06.019">CuGaS2</a>, where the results will be highly sensitive to the treatment of the 3d states and to the form of ionic charge compensation.</p>
<p>The main danger here is that experimentalists read these papers, get their hopes up, and ultimately lose respect for the predictive role of material simulation.</p>
