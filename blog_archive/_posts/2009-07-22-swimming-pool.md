The new RSC journal Energy &amp; Environmental Science were kind enough to allow me fill their <a title="http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/Journals/EE/article.asp?doi=b911442b" href="http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/Journals/EE/article.asp?doi=b911442b">cover</a> with metal oxides, water and hydrogen. The picture itself evolved from a combination of <a title="http://www.povray.org/" href="http://www.povray.org/">POVRAY</a> and <a title="http://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/~louis/software/ortep3/" href="http://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/%7Elouis/software/ortep3/">ORTEP</a>, with a little help from <a title="http://www.imagico.de/pov/water/index.html" href="http://www.imagico.de/pov/water/index.html">Christoph</a> for the water model. In the end there was so much ray tracing going on that I could have run a couple of DFT calculations by the time the final image was rasterized at high resolution.
