<p>There’s not much more to be said beyond the <a title="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v471/n7338/full/471306a.html?WT.ec_id=NATURE-20110317" href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v471/n7338/full/471306a.html?WT.ec_id=NATURE-20110317">obituary</a>, but some classic quotes from classic papers by the theoretical physicist Marshall Stoneham.</p>
<p>1. <a title="http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0953-8984/22/7/074211" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0953-8984/22/7/074211">The strange magnetism of oxides and carbons</a> (2010). “These ideas need careful work to be fully credible, but imply that simple oxides are far from simple”.<br />
2. <a title="http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0953-8984/19/25/255208" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0953-8984/19/25/255208">Trapping, self-trapping and the polaron family</a> (2007). “If there are really only two electrons, the ground state will be a singlet... if there are only two interesting electrons, the ground state can be a triplet”.<br />
3. <a title="http://iopscience.iop.org/0022-3719/16/22/010" href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0022-3719/16/22/010">Ionicity in solids</a> (1983). “The optimist may even construct quantitative, if empirical, rules involving an ionicity parameter”.<br />
4. <a title="http://www.us.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Physics/CondensedMatterPhysics/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780198507802" href="http://www.us.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Physics/CondensedMatterPhysics/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780198507802">Theory of defects in solids</a> (1975). “In principle, all these difficulties can be overcome by currently available methods. It remains to be seen whether this will be done”.<br />
5. <a title="http://iopscience.iop.org/0370-1328/86/6/302" href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0370-1328/86/6/302">The phonon bottleneck in paramagnetic crystals</a> (1965). “Whilst it is possible to find explanations consistent with the results, it is not yet possible to make reliable predictions”.</p>
<p>A final one that’s quite appropriate given the worldwide hysteria over events in Japan: “In the next half century, it is hard to see how demands for electricity can be met without expansions of nuclear fission power stations” from <a title="http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/368/1923.toc" href="http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/368/1923.toc">Nuclear fission: the interplay of science and technology</a> (2010).</p>
