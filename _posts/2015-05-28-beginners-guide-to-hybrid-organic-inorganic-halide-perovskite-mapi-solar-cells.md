<p>One challenge of working on hybrid halide perovskites is that the field is moving so rapidly. A second is that there are just too many publications. A third is that many of the older papers use different nomenclature so that it can be difficult to discover them. I started a <a href="https://www.mendeley.com/groups/4178551/hybrid-perovskite-solar-cells/">Mendeley group</a> to track papers, and I think we have done a decent job on the older literature (especially in the key work from the 1980s and 90s).  In 2014, there were over 400 publications on CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>, and there are likely to be over 1000 in 2015 alone, so it is almost impossible to absorb all available information.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><em>From a Web of Science search for "<span class="naturalOff nodisplay">hybrid perovskite OR MAPI OR CH3NH3PbI3 solar cell</span>" with 1564 results - 28th May 2015</em></p>
<p>Here is a suggested reading list to get started:</p>
<p>1. <a href="http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jcp/87/11/10.1063/1.453467"><strong>Dynamic disorder in methylammoniumtrihalogenoplumbates (II) observed by millimeter‐wave spectroscopy</strong> </a>(Journal of Chemical Physics, 1987) - Weber reported methylammonium lead iodide in 1978, but the interesting characterisation started here, with the first evidence for disorder due to molecular dipoles.</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022369790900217"><strong>Calorimetric and IR spectroscopic studies of phase transitions in methylammonium trihalogenoplumbates</strong></a> (Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids, 1990) - The <a href="http://ir.library.osaka-u.ac.jp/dspace/handle/11094/1049">PhD thesis</a> of Noriko Onoda-Yamamuro is a gold-mine of useful information and careful measurements. It began with a report of the heat capacity and IR spectrum.</p>
<p>3. <strong><a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v369/n6480/abs/369467a0.html">Conducting tin halides with a layered organic-based perovskite structure</a> </strong>(Nature, 1994) - David Mitzi kickstarted interest in the optoelectronic properties of organic-inorganic perovskites beginning here and publishing another 30 or so papers in the following decade.</p>
<p>4. <a href="http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2001/DT/b007070j#!divAbstract"><strong>Templating and structural engineering in organic–inorganic perovskites</strong></a> (Dalton Transaction, 2001) - Back to David Mitzi for a review on the chemical and structural diversity of this family of compounds.</p>
<p>5. <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja809598r"><strong>Organometal Halide Perovskites as Visible-Light Sensitizers for Photovoltaic Cells</strong> </a>(JACS, 2009) - The first solar cell from Japan, but note the substantial effort that had been put into developing these materials in advance.</p>
<p>6. <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/338/6107/643.abstract"><strong>Efficient Hybrid Solar Cells Based on Meso-Superstructured Organometal Halide Perovskites</strong> </a>(Science, 2012) - The first high-efficiency solid-state solar cell from Henry Snaith FRS and the point in time when the world took notice.</p>
<p>7. <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl500390f"><strong>Atomistic Origins of High-Performance in Hybrid Halide Perovskite Solar Cells</strong> </a>(Nano Letters, 2014) - Essentially a think piece, trying to link experimental observations with theory, and the first suggestion that lattice polarisation is important for the photovoltaic action.</p>
<p>8. <strong><a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v517/n7535/full/nature14133.html">Compositional engineering of perovskite materials for high-performance solar cells </a></strong>(Nature, 2015) - Things have progressed since 2012 with solar cells made with a variety of materials in a range of architectures. Sang Il Seok's group hold the record and it is with the complex formulation of meythlammonium/formamidinium - lead - iodide/bromide.</p>
<p>I wouldn't recommend to start with reading about device hysteresis. While the case is almost closed in my opinion, there is no definitive publication yet (just plenty of data and speculation).</p>
