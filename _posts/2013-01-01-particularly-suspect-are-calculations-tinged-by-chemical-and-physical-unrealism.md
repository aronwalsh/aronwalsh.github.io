<p>A critical essay on nanoscience by Roald Hoffmann appeared in the December issue of <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201206678/abstract">Angewandte Chemie</a>. Some important points are highlighted, including the (often neglected) roles of chemical passivisation and termination on material properties, as well as the inherent instability of nanostructures. Issues with both experimental and theoretical assumptions and reports are challenged. A biting start to 2013!</p>
