<p>In me are hidden constellations<br />
Once I managed to sight one<br />
through a lens of equations<br />
that could be solved only<br />
approximately. Still,<br />
with that imperfect rule<br />
I taught others the electrons’<br />
lobed motions. I’m wrong, often,<br />
I work this wild chemical<br />
garden with one old tool.</p>
<p>Let me show others the way to see.</p>
<p>An extract from ‘Somewhere’ by Roald Hoffmann.</p>
