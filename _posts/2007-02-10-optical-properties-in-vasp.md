<p>‘NAN’ is my least favorite high frequency dielectric constant. If the optical property subroutine in VASP worked better for magnetic systems, my life would be much easier. Time to move over to WIEN2K? I think so, well at least until VASP 5 comes out (this summer hopefully). Attending a WIEN workshop in June should ease the transition for the time being.</p>
