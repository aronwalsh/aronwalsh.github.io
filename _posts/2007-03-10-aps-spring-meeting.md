I attended the American Physical Society March Meeting in Denver at quite short notice this week. Considering the conference centre was five minutes from my apartment it didn’t cause me too much inconvenience. Running for a total of five days with at least a dozen parallel sessions, figuring out what talks to attend is no small feat.

<p>I picked up a new book at the Oxford Publishing stall. 20% off the retail price, which was nice. Leaning more towards physics (i.e. solid-state), <a title="http://www.amazon.com/Magnetism-Condensed-Matter-Oxford-Physics/dp/0198505914/ref=sr_1_1/102-1602665-7387349?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1174094821&amp;sr=8-1" href="http://www.amazon.com/Magnetism-Condensed-Matter-Oxford-Physics/dp/0198505914/ref=sr_1_1/102-1602665-7387349?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1174094821&amp;sr=8-1">‘Magnetism in condensed matter’</a> should bring me up to speed with what I missed out on during my undergrad (which mainly dealt with molecules). It reads quite well. I have rediscovered the magic of term symbols already. I will be super-exchanging with Fe 3d bands in no time at all.</p>
