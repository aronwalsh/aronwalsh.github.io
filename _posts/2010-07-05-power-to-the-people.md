Productivity has certainly increased with the lack of internet in Shanghai. Blocked sites: Facebook; Twitter; Blogger; Youtube; Wordpress. Google.com is also a bit peculiar, but google.ie appears to work fine. As it is my second trip to Fudan University, I feel like I am getting to know the place. Highlights: the college canteen consists of over a dozen counters, each serving a different type of food (my favourite is a big plate of vegetable egg fried rice for ~50p); the metro system has been extended to 10 lines, all air conditioned and costing 40p to travel around the city; free museums; 24 shopping malls; everyone being world-expo crazy.

<p> In relation to science, I was fortunate enough to participate in a workshop on multiscale modelling organised by <a title="http://www.physics.fudan.edu.cn/xggong/" href="http://www.physics.fudan.edu.cn/xggong/">Xingao Gong</a> and <a title="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~hxiang/" href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/%7Ehxiang/">Hongjun Xiang</a> at Fudan. I learned that <a title="http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/v9/n7/full/nmat2771.html" href="http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/v9/n7/full/nmat2771.html">ternary topological insulators</a> are *the* hot topic in solid-state physics; the missing ingredient in the empirical B3LYP functional is an <a title="http://www.pnas.org/content/106/13/4963.full" href="http://www.pnas.org/content/106/13/4963.full">MP2 term</a>; surface plasmons have a role to play in the <a title="http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.78.235413" href="http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.78.235413">spectroscopy of nanoparticles</a>. I also had the opportunity to visit the brand new <a title="http://faculty.ecnu.edu.cn/duanchungang/Info_eng.html" href="http://faculty.ecnu.edu.cn/duanchungang/Info_eng.html">Laboratory for Polar Materials and Devices</a> at East China Normal University: an impressive mix of crystal growth, characterisation and theory (an integrated “family”), with a strong focus on multiferroic oxides.</p>
<p>After Fudan, I will stop in Beijing for the <a title="http://icsnn2010.semi.ac.cn/dct/Wiki.jsp?page=Main" href="http://icsnn2010.semi.ac.cn/dct/Wiki.jsp?page=Main">ICSNN</a>, and then finally Seoul for the <a title="http://icps2010.org/" href="http://icps2010.org/">ICPS</a>: a Summer living out of a suitcase.
