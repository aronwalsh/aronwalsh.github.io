<p>One of the strengths in the UCL Chemistry Department is structure prediction, so I was excited to collaborate with <a title="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/klmc/People/Woodley.html" href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/klmc/People/Woodley.html">Scott Woodley</a> on the low energy structures formed for clusters of In2O3. Scott recently co-authored a nice review of global optimisation techniques in <a title="http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/v7/n12/abs/nmat2321.html" href="http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/v7/n12/abs/nmat2321.html">Nature Materials</a>.</p>
<p>In our <a title="http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2010/CP/c0cp00056f" href="http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2010/CP/c0cp00056f">work</a>, one of the key results was that the energy landscape found for a classical potential model that <a title="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cm9020113" href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cm9020113">we developed </a>and density functional theory were very similar. The project also allowed me to try out quasi-particle calculations (GW theory) within the FHI-AIMS code to investigate the spectroscopic properties.</p>
<p>I have collected the low energy structures that we found for (In2O3)n, from 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, which are available <a href="https://github.com/WMD-Bath/nano-In2O3">here</a> for those who are curious of the nanochemistry of indium oxide.</p>
