<p>I often find it hard to sink my mind into fiction. Some science books that have helped me calm down at the end of the day:</p>
<p>• <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Strangest-Man-Hidden-Mystic/dp/B004NSVF5O/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1335104142&amp;sr=1-1">"The Strangest Man: The Hidden Life of Paul Dirac, Mystic of the Atom" Graham Farmelo.</a> The story of a reclusive boy from Bristol who went on to be England's greatest quantum physicist. Full of detail, charm and sadness.<br />
• <a title="http://www.amazon.com/Disappearing-Spoon-Madness-Periodic-Elements/dp/0316051640" href="http://www.amazon.com/Disappearing-Spoon-Madness-Periodic-Elements/dp/0316051640">“The Disappearing Spoon” Sam Kean.</a> Curious facts and stories surrounding the periodic table; told with warmth and charm.<br />
•  <a title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Story-Number-Eli-Maor/dp/0691058547" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Story-Number-Eli-Maor/dp/0691058547">“e: The Story of a Number” Eli Maor.</a> The book proves that e is just as interesting as pi (I had even forgotten they were <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_identity" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_identity">related</a>).<br />
•  <a title="http://www.amazon.com/Same-Not-Roald-Hoffmann/dp/0231101392" href="http://www.amazon.com/Same-Not-Roald-Hoffmann/dp/0231101392">“The Same but not the Same” Roald Hoffmann.</a> The role of symmetry (and general philosophising) in Chemistry.<br />
•  <a title="http://www.badscience.net/" href="http://www.badscience.net/">“Bad Science” Ben Goldcare.</a> People can believe anything; con-artists can have PhDs.<br />
•  <a title="http://www.amazon.com/Big-Bang-Universe-Simon-Singh/dp/0007162200" href="http://www.amazon.com/Big-Bang-Universe-Simon-Singh/dp/0007162200">“Big Bang” Simon Singh.</a> Clear, comprehensive, and a joy to read.<br />
•  <a title="http://www.amazon.com/Cathedrals-Science-Personalities-Rivalries-Chemistry/dp/0195321340" href="http://www.amazon.com/Cathedrals-Science-Personalities-Rivalries-Chemistry/dp/0195321340">“Cathedrals of Science” Patrick Coffey. </a>The stories behind the pillars of physical chemistry.<br />
• <a title="http://www.amazon.com/Surely-Feynman-Adventures-Curious-Character/dp/0393316041/ref=pd_sim_b_1" href="http://www.amazon.com/Surely-Feynman-Adventures-Curious-Character/dp/0393316041/ref=pd_sim_b_1">“Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!” Richard Feynman and Ralph Leighton.</a> As essential for growing up as Catcher in the Rye. Avoid the Matthew Broderick movie, but the recent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Feynman-Jim-Ottaviani/dp/1596432594">graphic novel</a> complements the book nicely.<br />
• <a title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Chemical-Bonding-Dialogue-Inorganic-Chemistry/dp/0471971294" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Chemical-Bonding-Dialogue-Inorganic-Chemistry/dp/0471971294">“Chemical Bonding: A Dialogue” </a><a title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Chemical-Bonding-Dialogue-Inorganic-Chemistry/dp/0471971294" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Chemical-Bonding-Dialogue-Inorganic-Chemistry/dp/0471971294">Jeremy Burdett.</a> It is beyond pop science, but a stimulating read, in a unique Q&amp;A format, concerning fundamental concepts and applications in quantum chemistry.
