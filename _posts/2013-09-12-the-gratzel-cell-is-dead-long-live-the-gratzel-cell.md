<p>.... 20 years later. A 2011 review: <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jz200668q">"Although much more is now known about the physical and chemical processes taking place during operation of the DSC [dye-sensitised solar cell], the exponential increase in research effort during this period has not been matched by large increases in efficiency."</a></p>

<p>There has been a rapid year of progress in the area of dye-sensitised solar cells. Many review papers have been appearing that are out of date <em>before</em> page numbers are assigned. The magic word is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perovskite">perovskite</a> (referring to the crystal structure), whether it be inorganic (CsSnI3) or hybrid organic-inorganic (CH3NH3PbI3). These materials absorb a lot of sunlight and can produce voltages approaching the band gaps of the material. Very impressive!</p>
<p>One of the most interesting developments has been the transition from a mesoporous scaffold of TiO2 to a scaffold of Al2O3 to <a href="http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/adfm.201302090">no scaffold</a> at all. It is clear that the technology is converging away from the original dye-cell architecture towards traditional thin-film solar cells. Many key issues remain, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pb-free absorber materials.</li>
<li>Replace Spiro-OMeTAD as the p-type layer (for the sake of atomistic modelling at least).</li>
<li>Make efficient cells with active areas &gt;&gt; 0.2 cm2*.</li>
<li>Explain how they work: Electric fields? (Yes), Free carriers? (Yes), Excitons? (No), Ion diffusion? (Yes)</li>
</ul>
<p>We have been modelling these systems since 2012 thanks to the <a href="http://www.destiny-itn.eu/">EU DESTINY</a> network. Our contributions [updated]:</p>

<p>There are no easy answers; standard perovskites are <a href="http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/368/1923/3379.abstract">notoriously difficult</a> to model, hybrid perovskites are a nightmare. It is always nice to be challenged! To keep track of the field, I have started a <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/groups/4178551/hybrid-perovskite-solar-cells/">hybrid perovskite paper collection</a>.</p>
<p><em>*There is something uncomfortable about efficiencies reported with an active area as small as <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature12509.html">0.075 cm2</a>. Plenty of room for noise &amp; artifacts, and not in the spirit of a practical solar cell.</em></p>
