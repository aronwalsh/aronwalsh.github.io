<p>The consensus from decades of condensed matter theory research, using a variety of basis sets and independent implementations, is that the local density approximation (LDA) to density functional theory (DFT) underestimates the band gaps of semiconducting or insulating materials. The reason for this is known and well documented [e.g. <a title="http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v51/i20/p1888_1" href="http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v51/i20/p1888_1">Sham and Schlüter, 1983</a>].</p>
<p>To some, this is a conspiracy of the highest order:</p>

<p>The general message from this series of comments (in high profile journals) is that the LDA is fine as it is - at least in the implementation of Bagayoko, Zhao, and Williams. An explanation for the results can be found in a reply to one of the comments from <a title="http://prb.aps.org/abstract/PRB/v76/i3/e037102" href="http://prb.aps.org/abstract/PRB/v76/i3/e037102">Furthmüller et al</a>: "Bagayoko et al. used minimal basis sets of atomic-like orbitals... they were able to determine reasonable gaps of semiconductors already within DFT-LDA. We cannot deny the success of this approach; however, in our opinion this success is somehow accidental...  minimal basis sets open gaps between occupied and unoccupied states.” They were too polite to quote Einstein: “Marvelous, what ideas the young people have these days. But I don't believe a word of it.”</p>
