Having spent (invested) almost eight years of my life at the University of Dublin, Trinity College, now has been a natural time to move on. I was quite lucky in the positions I chose to apply for. In the end the Rockies won out, and I have just started as a postdoctoral researcher at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. How will things progress from here? That’s a problem for future me.

<p> I used to spend a lot of time writing and making videos about music. Seeing as I have moved countries for science, I should give it a bit more attention! (hence this site). There’s no general purpose or direct motive, just some random talk and a place for me to keep note of my progress (as I can be quite forgetful at times).</p>
