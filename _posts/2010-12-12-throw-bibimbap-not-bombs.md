To make sure that airlines don’t go out of business in this tough economic climate, I am just back from a very stimulating week in Seoul, where I visited Seoul National University and Yonsei University.

<p> At Yonsei, <a title="http://yonseimtg.weebly.com/index.html" href="http://yonseimtg.weebly.com/index.html">Aloysius Soon</a> has been making a great effort to establish a collaborative network of material theorists, in the same spirit as the TYC in London. I was honoured to speak in their <a title="http://icms3.weebly.com/schedule.html" href="http://icms3.weebly.com/schedule.html">symposium series</a>.</p>
<p>At SNU, I spent time visiting many of the professors in the <a title="http://phya.snu.ac.kr/" href="http://phya.snu.ac.kr/">Department of Physics</a> - in Korea there is a split between fundamental materials research and research applied to topics of interest for industry (Samsung, LG, etc.). At SNU they balance this very well: a number of groups study fundamental issues associated with topological insulators, superconductors, multi-ferrorics, while treating applied issues associated with phase change memory, resistance-switching in oxide-based RAM, and thin-film field effect transistors. Having a grasp of both extremes can be very rewarding academically. I learned a lot from my short stay (with many new project ideas).</p>
<p>It was a stimulating week (filled with many culinary delights that are unique to Korea), to end a stimulating year. Happy winter holidays to all and sundry!</p>
