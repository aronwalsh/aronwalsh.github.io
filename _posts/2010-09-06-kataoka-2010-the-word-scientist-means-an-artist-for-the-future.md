After jumping into the handheld computer market too early with a Palm Zire back in 2000, I gave the iPhone a few years to mature before hopping onto that bandwagon. Now that I have arrived, it is time to get equipped with all of those essential applications. For “science” (and personal entertainment), the most useful apps have been:<br />
1. <a title="https://www.dropbox.com/" href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> (Free) - Both a pdf storage and viewing solution. It is also incredibly useful for synching active projects between home and work desktops.<br />
2. <a title="http://www.sunsetlakesoftware.com/molecules" href="http://www.sunsetlakesoftware.com/molecules">Molecules</a> (Free) - A trouble free 3D viewer for pdb files.<br />
3. <a title="http://itunes.apple.com/app/atom-in-a-box/id284788633?mt=8" href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/atom-in-a-box/id284788633?mt=8">Atom in a Box</a> ($9.99) - I can’t afford this, but the graphics look beautiful. Rotating g and f functions could easily pass a long train trip.<br />
4. <a title="http://foursquare.com/" href="http://foursquare.com/">Foursquare </a>(Free) - Social network with GPS could be viewed as the death of privacy, or a gateway to stalking. I tend to be more optimistic, it tells you what fun places are close by (useful at conferences at least?). Maybe Foursquare will disappear with the advent of Facebook places.<br />
5. <a title="http://www.koolistov.net/products/waterfall/" href="http://www.koolistov.net/products/waterfall/">Waterfall</a> (Free) - Tetris combined with the ice obsession of the UCL Chemistry Department.<br />
6. <a title="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ssh-terminal/id349802156?mt=8" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ssh-terminal/id349802156?mt=8">SSH Terminal</a> ($0.99) - Perfect for that covert Sunday afternoon combination of “qstat” and “qsub” - it stores username and passwords, so you can connect to any machine with a single click.<br />
7. <a title="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mobilerss-pro-google-rss-news/id325594202?mt=8" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mobilerss-pro-google-rss-news/id325594202?mt=8">Mobile RSS</a> (Free) - A nice interface to google reader, to pass the time with new publications in real time.<br />
8. <a title="http://itunes.apple.com/app/graphing-calculator/id289940142?mt=8" href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/graphing-calculator/id289940142?mt=8">Graphing Calculator </a>($1.99) - The interface is beautiful. It provides a fully functioning scientific calculator and the ability to graph multiple functions - very nice for playing with molecular mechanics forcefields while on the move.<em>
	
(The title quote from an Author Profile in <a title="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/123581923/abstract" href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/123581923/abstract">Angewandte Chemie</a> is in nice contrast to the classic “Art is I; science is we” by Claude Bernard).</em>
